<objective>
Validate, consolidate, and polish the three foundation docs (SKILL.md, docs/README.md, docs/INSTALLATION.md) so they are accurate against the actual codebase and remove the duplicate docs/SKILL.md.

Purpose: These docs already exist with substantial content from v1.0 development. This plan validates them against source code, fixes any inaccuracies (e.g., the build command is `npm run build-workflow -- <file>` not `npx ts-node build`), consolidates the duplicate SKILL.md, and ensures all three success criteria are met.

Output: Three polished, verified docs and one removed duplicate.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Validate and polish SKILL.md, remove docs/SKILL.md duplicate</name>
  <files>SKILL.md, docs/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Read src/index.ts to confirm all public exports match what SKILL.md documents. Verify:
       - workflow, compileWorkflow, validateWorkflow, createTypedNodes, ref, expr are all documented
       - calculateGridPosition is exported but NOT user-facing (internal) — confirm it's not documented (correct)
       - generateNodeType, generateNodeTypes are CLI internals — confirm not in SKILL.md (correct)
       - analyzeDisplayOptions, buildDiscriminatedUnions, deduplicateProperties are internals — confirm not documented (correct)

    2. Validate all code examples in SKILL.md compile conceptually:
       - Import paths use './src/index.js' (correct for project-root workflows)
       - Pattern 5 (typed API) correctly shows how to wire createTypedNodes() with the builder
       - CLI commands match package.json scripts (build-workflow, extract, generate, validate, test)

    3. Verify the SKILL.md frontmatter is correct:
       - name: n8n_onIon
       - version: should match package.json version
       - description: accurate

    4. Delete docs/SKILL.md (it's an identical duplicate of root SKILL.md). The root SKILL.md is the canonical location for Claude skill files.

    5. Verify SKILL.md has all content needed for success criterion 1: Claude can read it and generate a valid workflow without any other context. Check:
       - Has import statement examples
       - Has complete workflow patterns (trigger -> node -> connect -> export default)
       - Has compileWorkflow usage
       - Has CLI build command
       - Has expression system (ref, expr)
       - Has typed API usage
       - Has error handling guidance
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `diff SKILL.md docs/SKILL.md` should fail (docs/SKILL.md deleted)
    - `! test -f docs/SKILL.md` returns 0 (file gone)
    - SKILL.md contains all public API functions from src/index.ts that are user-facing
    - All 5 common patterns have complete, self-contained code examples
  </verify>
  <done>
    SKILL.md is validated against source code, all examples are accurate, docs/SKILL.md duplicate is removed. Claude can read SKILL.md alone and produce a valid workflow file.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Validate and polish docs/README.md and docs/INSTALLATION.md</name>
  <files>docs/README.md, docs/INSTALLATION.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Validate docs/README.md:
       - Quick Start example uses correct commands (`npm run build-workflow -- my-workflow.ts`)
       - Documentation table links to all planned docs (INSTALLATION, API, GUIDES, EXAMPLES, TROUBLESHOOTING, NODES)
       - "How It Works" section accurately describes the pipeline
       - Current Coverage stats are accurate (797 schemas, 5 typed nodes)
       - Project Structure tree matches actual directory layout (verify with ls)
       - Remove any reference to docs/SKILL.md from the documentation table (SKILL.md lives at project root, not in docs/)

    2. Validate docs/INSTALLATION.md:
       - All npm commands are correct and match package.json
       - The build command is `npm run build-workflow -- <file>` (NOT `npx ts-node build`)
       - Expected output from build matches actual CLI output format
       - Test count matches (61 tests)
       - .env.example reference — verify .env.example exists, or adjust text
       - npm Scripts Reference table is complete and accurate
       - Troubleshooting section error messages match actual error output from source code
       - Day-to-Day Usage workflow is accurate

    3. Cross-check: docs/README.md links to docs/INSTALLATION.md correctly (relative path INSTALLATION.md).

    4. If .env.example doesn't exist, either create a minimal one or update INSTALLATION.md to say "Create a .env file" instead of "copy from .env.example".
  </action>
  <verify>
    - docs/README.md documentation table has 6 entries (Installation, API, Guides, Examples, Troubleshooting, Nodes)
    - docs/README.md does NOT reference docs/SKILL.md
    - docs/INSTALLATION.md uses `npm run build-workflow` (not `npx ts-node build`)
    - All npm script names in INSTALLATION.md match package.json
    - `npm run build-workflow -- test-workflows/01-webhook-slack.ts` actually runs successfully (test this)
  </verify>
  <done>
    docs/README.md and docs/INSTALLATION.md are validated against the actual codebase. A developer reading README understands purpose and navigation. A developer following INSTALLATION.md can go from zero to compiled workflow.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

Run these checks after both tasks complete:

1. `test -f SKILL.md && echo "SKILL.md exists"` — root SKILL.md present
2. `! test -f docs/SKILL.md && echo "duplicate removed"` — no duplicate
3. `npm run build-workflow -- test-workflows/01-webhook-slack.ts` — compiles successfully
4. `npm run test` — all 61 tests pass (docs didn't break anything)
5. Grep SKILL.md for all user-facing exports: workflow, createTypedNodes, compileWorkflow, validateWorkflow, ref, expr
6. Grep docs/README.md for documentation table completeness
7. Grep docs/INSTALLATION.md for correct build command
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Claude can read SKILL.md and generate a valid workflow without any other context — verified by checking all API functions, patterns, and CLI commands are documented with complete examples
2. A developer reading docs/README.md understands the SDK purpose, sees a quick start example, and knows where to find every other doc — verified by documentation table having all 6 entries
3. A developer following docs/INSTALLATION.md can go from zero to a working `npm run build-workflow` that produces valid n8n JSON — verified by running the build command successfully
4. No duplicate docs/SKILL.md exists
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/06-foundation-docs/06-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
