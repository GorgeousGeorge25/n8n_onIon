## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Discriminated unions for type branching (best fit chosen during implementation)
- REST API + MCP hybrid for schema access (MCP for dev, REST API for CLI)
- 5-node v1 scope (prove architecture before scaling)
- Claude-first API design (optimize for AI code generation patterns)
- ESM over CommonJS (01-01: better TypeScript support, native Node 18+)
- Native fetch over axios (01-01: zero dependencies, built-in)
- File-based JSON cache (01-01: simplicity, git-friendly, human-readable)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Schema extraction not yet tested against live n8n instance (01-01)
- Unknown if n8n REST API schema format exactly matches type definitions (01-01)
